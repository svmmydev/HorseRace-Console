/**
 * This class represents the console view for the Horse Race Betting game.
 * It provides various console output functionalities for interaction with users,
 * displaying messages, and gathering user input to control the game flow.
 * It is instantiated only in the GameController class, where all its methods will be called.
 * <hr>
 * <p><b>Responsibilities include:</b></p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Displaying messages and prompts for player actions (such as placing bets, choosing horses).</li>
 * <li>Showing game information, including leaderboards, race updates, and game results.</li>
 * <li>Providing narration of the race's progress.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>Methods within this class are designed for different stages of the game, from setup
 * (player input and welcome messages) to game progression (displaying player actions,
 * leaderboard updates) and end of the game (winning announcements).</p>
